			The sample time of the generated sine wave.
			This value influences the "graininess" of the output signal and the maximum frecuency that the controller can generate.
			A value of 100us corresponds to about a maximum frecuency of 1.25kHz, while a value of 500us yields a maximum frecuency of 250Hz
